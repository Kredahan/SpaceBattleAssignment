# SpaceBattleAssignment
A Unity Project built to recreate the brief but powerful battle between Tetsuo and the spaceship 'SOL' from the movie Akira. Its more of a reimagining of this scene than an accurate depiction, as the battle scene in Akira was extremely short, whereas this battle is longer and features more participants. Had to remake the repository due to unsolvable merge conflicts.
